# Machine-extracted Source-local Implementation Contract

This appendix is deterministic evidence extracted from the target source.
It is not an LLM summary and it does not contain complete function bodies.

During regeneration:
- preserve the exact local declaration types, containers, initializers, and literals listed below;
- preserve the exact call targets and argument expressions listed below;
- do not substitute a different representation or accessor merely because it looks similar;
- treat these items as exact constraints, not as pseudocode suggestions.

## Exact local declarations

- `int i = 0x20000 - 0x10;`

## Exact top-level call expressions

- `memset(mem, 0, sizeof(mem))`
- `check_addr(addr)`
